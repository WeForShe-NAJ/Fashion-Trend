#Identifying Current Trends
To extract current trends, we make use of e-commerce websites. But why?
E-commerce websites like Myntra,Flipcart, Nordstorm etc. give a good representation of what people are liking and buying online. The reviews, rating, number of rating, number of reviews give a good impression of what today's trends are. It gives an indirect representation of how a product is doing in the market. A good product would have more positive reviews and higher ratings. This would show that the particular product has features that are being liked by the audience. We can use the images provided by the e-commerce websites to come up with a mood board which showcases what is trending and what is not!
